\title{Launch the Metadata Curation Shiny App}
\usage{
launch_curation_app(launch.browser = TRUE, port = NULL, host = "127.0.0.1")
}
\arguments{
\item{launch.browser}{Logical. If TRUE (default), opens the app in the
system's default web browser. If FALSE, the app opens in the RStudio
viewer pane (if available).}

\item{port}{Integer. The TCP port that the application should listen on.
If NULL (default), a random port is chosen.}

\item{host}{Character string. The IPv4 address that the application should
listen on. Defaults to "127.0.0.1" (localhost).}
}
\value{
No return value. The function runs the Shiny app until it is stopped.

\description{
Opens an interactive Shiny application for curating and validating metadata
against the OmicsMLRepoCuration schema. The app provides features for data
upload, editing, validation, and schema browsing.
}
\details{
The Metadata Curation App provides an interactive interface for:
\itemize{
  \item Uploading CSV/TSV metadata files or creating new templates
  \item Editing data in an interactive table (add/delete rows and columns)
  \item Validating data against the schema with real-time feedback
  \item Browsing schema field definitions and requirements
  \item Checking dynamic enum configurations (ontology-based)
  \item Downloading curated and validated data
}

The app validates against the current schema and highlights:
\itemize{
  \item Required fields (yellow background)
  \item Validation errors (missing required fields, type mismatches)
  \item Warnings (pattern violations, potential issues)
  \item Dynamic enum fields with ontology roots
}
}
\section{Required Packages}{

The app requires the following packages to be installed:
\itemize{
  \item shiny
  \item shinydashboard
  \item DT
  \item yaml
  \item dplyr
  \item readr
  \item jsonlite
}

Install missing packages with:
\code{install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "DT", "yaml", "dplyr", "readr", "jsonlite"))}
}

\section{Workflow}{

A typical curation workflow:
\enumerate{
  \item Upload existing metadata file or create a new template
  \item Edit data in the interactive table
  \item Run validation to check for errors
  \item Review validation results and fix issues
  \item Browse schema for field definitions as needed
  \item Download validated data
}
}

\section{Dynamic Enums}{

The app supports dynamic enums that use ontology hierarchies:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{ancestry}: Uses HANCESTRO ontology children
  \item \strong{ancestry_details}: Uses HANCESTRO ontology descendants
  \item Check Schema Browser tab for specific ontology roots
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Launch app in browser
launch_curation_app()

# Launch app in RStudio viewer
launch_curation_app(launch.browser = FALSE)

# Launch on specific port
launch_curation_app(port = 3838)
}

}
