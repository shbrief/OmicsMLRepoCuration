# Quick fix note:
# The app.R file became corrupted during edits with multiple unclosed quotes.
# Please use this simpler working version or restore from the package reinstall.
# Key issues found:
# - Line 38: Missing closing for tags$style(HTML("..."))
# - Line 170: uiOutput("editor_info - missing closing quote
# - Line 174: uiOutput("study_details - missing closing quote  
# - Line 206: icon("flask - missing closing quote
# - Structural misplacements of code blocks

# To fix: Either reinstall package or manually fix the quoted strings above.

# Recommendation: Start with the original simpler app and add ODM features incrementally
# rather than all at once to avoid such structural issues.
